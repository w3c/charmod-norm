      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <section id="goals">
        <h3>Goals and Scope</h3>
        
        <p>The goal of the Character Model for the World Wide Web is to facilitate use of the Web by all people, regardless of their language, script, writing system, or cultural conventions, in accordance with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission"><cite>W3C goal of universal access</cite></a>. One basic prerequisite to achieve this goal is to be able to transmit and process the characters used around the world in a well-defined and well-understood way.</p>
        
        <p class="note">This document builds on <cite>Character Model for the World Wide Web: Fundamentals</cite> [[CHARMOD]]. Understanding the concepts in that document are important to being able to understand and apply this document successfully.</p>
        
        <p>This part of the Character Model for the World Wide Web covers string 
		matching—the process by which a specification or implementation defines 
		whether two string values are the same or different from one another. It 
		describes the ways in which texts that are semantically equivalent can 
		be encoded differently and the impact this has on matching operations 
		important to formal languages (such as those used in the formats and 
		protocols that make up the Web).</p>
        <p>The main target audience of this specification is W3C specification
          developers. This specification and parts of it can be referenced from
          other W3C specifications and it defines conformance criteria for W3C
          specifications, as well as other specifications.</p>
        <p>Other audiences of this specification include software developers,
          content developers, and authors of specifications outside the W3C.
          Software developers and content developers implement and use W3C
          specifications. This specification defines some conformance criteria
          for implementations (software) and content that implement and use W3C
          specifications. It also helps software developers and content
          developers to understand the character-related provisions in W3C
          specifications.</p>
        <p>The character model described in this specification provides authors
          of specifications, software developers, and content developers with a
          common reference for consistent, interoperable text manipulation on
          the World Wide Web. Working together, these three groups can build a
          globally accessible Web.</p>

      <section id="structure">
        <h3>Structure of this Document</h3>
        <p>This document defines one of the basic building blocks for the Web related
          to this problem by defining rules and processes for String
          Identity Matching in document formats. These rules are designed for
          the identifiers and structural markup (<a href="#def_syntactic_content" class="termref">syntactic content</a>) 
		used in document formats to ensure consistent processing of each and are 
		targeted to Specification writers. This
          section is targeted to implementers.</p>
        <p>This document is divided into two main sections.</p>
        <p>The <a href="#problemStatement">first section</a> lays out the
          problems involved in string matching; the effects of Unicode and case
          folding on these problems; and outlines the various issues and
          normalization mechanisms that might be used to address these issues.</p>
        <p>The <a href="#identityMatching">second section</a> provides
          requirements and recommendations for string identity matching for use
          in <span class="qterm">formal languages</span>, such as many of the
          document formats defined in W3C Specifications. This primarily is
          concerned with making the Web functional and providing document
          authors with consistent results. </p>
      </section>
      <section id="background">
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>This section provides some historical background on the topics
          addressed in this specification.</p>
        <p>At the core of the character model is the Universal Character Set
          (UCS), defined jointly by the <cite>Unicode Standard</cite>
          [[!Unicode]] and ISO/IEC 10646 [[!ISO10646]]. In this document, <dfn>Unicode</dfn>
          is used as a synonym for the Universal Character Set. A successful
          character model allows Web documents authored in the world's writing
          systems, scripts, and languages (and on different platforms) to be
          exchanged, read, and searched by the Web's users around the world.</p>
        <p>The first few chapters of the <cite>Unicode Standard</cite>
          [[!Unicode]] provide useful background reading.</p>
        <p>For information about the requirements that informed the development
          of important parts of this specification, see <cite>Requirements for
            String Identity Matching and String Indexing</cite> [[CHARREQ]].</p>
      </section>
      <section id="terminology">
        <h3>Terminology and Notation</h3>
        
        <p>This section contains terminology and notation specific to this document.</p>
        
        <p>The Web is built on text-based formats and protocols. In order to
          describe string matching or searching effectively, it is necessary to
          establish terminology that allows us to talk about the different kinds
          of text within a given format or protocol, as the requirements and
          details vary significantly. </p>
          
        <p>A <dfn data-lt="Unicode code point|Unicode code points|code point|code points">Unicode code point</dfn> (or "code point") refers to the numeric value assigned to each Unicode character. Unicode code points range from <code class="kw" translate="no">0</code> to <code class="kw" translate="no">0x10FFFF</code>. (See Section 4.1 in [[!CHARMOD]] for a deeper discussion of character encoding terminology.)</p>
          
        <p>Unicode code points are denoted as <code class="kw" translate="no">U+<em>hhhh</em></code>, where <code class="kw" translate="no"><em>hhhh</em></code> is a sequence of at least four, and at most six hexadecimal digits. For example, the character <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x20AC;</span> [<span class="uname">U+20AC EURO SIGN</span>]</span> has the code point <span class="uname" translate="no">U+20AC</span>, while the character <span class="codepoint">&#x1f63a;</span> [<span class="uname">U+1F63A SMILING CAT FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH</span>] has the code point <span class="uname" translate="no">U+1F63A</span>.</p>
          
        <p>Some characters used in this document's examples might not appear as intended on your specific device or display. Usually this is due to lack of a script-specific font installed locally or due to other limitations of your specific rendering system. This document uses a Webfont to provide fallback glyphs for many of the non-Latin characters, but your device might not support displaying the font. To the degree possible, the editors have tried to ensure that the examples nevertheless remain understandable.</p>
          
        <p>A <dfn data-lt="legacy character encoding|legacy character encodings">legacy character encoding</dfn> is a character encoding form that does not encode the full repertoire of characters in the Unicode character set.</p>
          
                   
        <p>A <dfn data-lt="transcoder|transcoders">transcoder</dfn> is a process that converts 
		text between two character encodings. Most commonly in this document it 
		refers to a process that converts from a <a>legacy character encoding</a> 
        to a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/REC-charmod-20050215/#Unicode_Encoding_Form">Unicode encoding form</a>, 
		such as UTF-8.</p>
		
		<p><dfn data-lt="natural language">Natural language</dfn> is the spoken, written, or signed communications used by human beings (see also <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ltli/#dfn-natural-language">here</a> [[LTLI]])</p>
		
        <p><dfn data-lt="syntactic content" id="def_syntactic_content">Syntactic content</dfn> is any text in a document format or protocol that belongs to the structure of the format or protocol. This definition includes values that are typically thought of as "markup" but can also include other values, such as the name of a field in an HTTP header. Syntactic content consists of all of the characters that form the <em>structure</em> of a format or protocol. For example, <span class="qchar">&lt;</span> and <span class="qchar">&gt;</span> (as well as the element name and various attributes they surround) are part of the syntactic content in an HTML document.</p>
        
        <p>Syntactic content usually is defined by a specification or specifications and includes both the defined, reserved keywords for the given protocol or format as well as string tokens and identifiers that are defined by document authors to form the structure of the document (rather than the "content" of the document).</p>
        
        <p>A <dfn id="def_vocabulary">vocabulary</dfn> is the list of reserved keywords and/or rules for assigning <a>user-supplied values</a> (such as identifiers) in a format or protocol. This can include restrictions on range, order, or type of characters that can appear in different places.</p>
        
        <p>For example, HTML defines the names of its elements and attributes, as well as enumerated attribute values, which defines the "vocabulary" of HTML <a>syntactic content</a>. Another example would be ECMAScript, which restricts the range of characters that can appear at the start or in the body of an identifier or variable name. It applies different rules for other cases, such as to the values of string literals.</p>
		
		<p>Values within a <a>vocabulary</a> fall into two broad classes: those that are meant to be seen, read, or interacted with by humans (and thus might be expected to contain natural language text); and those that are application or protocol internal and not intended for human interaction.</p>
		
		<p>A <dfn>user-facing identifier</dfn> is an identifier defined by or assigned by a user in a <a>vocabulary</a> that is intended to be at least potentially visible to end-users (and thus is <a>localizable content</a>).</p>
		
		<p>An <dfn>application internal identifier</dfn> is an identifier defined by or assigned by a user in a <a>vocabulary</a> that is internal to the document format or protocol and not intended for human interaction. Such values are generally not <a>localizable content</a>.</p>
        
        <p>A <dfn data-lt="user-supplied value|user-supplied values">user-supplied value</dfn> is unreserved <a>syntactic content</a> in a <a>vocabulary</a> that is assigned by users, as distinct from reserved keywords in a given format or protocol. Users generally expect that their user-supplied values can be words or phrases in their preferred <a>natural language</a>. This is why [[CHARMOD]] recommends that "Specifications SHOULD NOT arbitrarily exclude code points from the full range of Unicode code points from <code>U+0000</code> to <code>U+10FFFF</code> inclusive."</p>
        
        <aside class="example">
		  <p>CSS defines the syntax of a style sheet and reserves a number of keywords, such as <code>margin-left</code> or <code>font-family</code>, or values such as <code>10px</code>. All of these definitions are part of the <a>syntactic content</a> of a CSS style sheet. CSS also allows users to define certain values such as class names using a wide range of Unicode characters. These <a>user-supplied values</a> are also part of the <a>syntactic content</a> of the style sheet where they appear.</p>
        </aside>
        
        <aside class="example">
          <p><cite>XML</cite> [[XML10]] defines specific elements, attributes, and values that are reserved across all XML documents. Thus, the word <code class="kw" translate="no">encoding</code> has a defined meaning inside the XML document declaration: it is a reserved name. XML also allows a user to define elements and attributes for a given document, for example, by using a DTD. In a document that uses a DTD that defines an element called <code class="kw">&lt;muffin&gt;</code>, <span class="qterm">muffin</span> is a part of the syntactic content.</p>
        </aside>
        
        <p><dfn>Localizable content</dfn> refers to document contents intended as human-readable text and <b>not</b> to any of the surrounding or embedded syntactic content that form part of the document structure. Note that syntactic content can have localizable content embedded in it, such as when an [[HTML]] <code class="kw">img</code> element has an <code class="kw">alt</code> attribute containing a description of the image.</p>
        
        <aside class="example">
	       <p>Here is an example (similar to the one found in [[STRING-META]]) of a JSON document containing a mixture of syntactic and localizable content. The values whose key is <code>value</code> (in the fields <code>title</code>, <code>author</code>, and <code>publisher</code>) are localizable content. Notice that they are associated with language and base direction metadata.</p>
	       <p>The keys (<code>isbn</code>, <code>bookLanguage</code>, <code>title</code> etc.) are application internal identifiers in this document's vocabulary. Values such as the publication date (<code>2008-01-01</code>) are user-supplied values.</p>

        <p>A <dfn data-lt="resource|resources">resource</dfn>, in the context of this document,  is a given document, file, or protocol "message" which includes both the <a>localizable content</a> as well as the <a>syntactic content</a> such as identifiers surrounding or containing it. For example, in an HTML document that also has some CSS and a few <code class="kw" translate="no">script</code> tags with embedded JavaScript, the entire HTML document, considered as a file, is a resource. This term is intentionally similar to the term 'resource' as used in [[RFC3986]], although here the term is applied loosely. </p>
          
	
        <p>A <dfn data-lt="grapheme|graphemes">grapheme</dfn> is a sequence of
          one or more characters in a visual representation of some text
          that a typical user would perceive as being a single unit (<q>character</q>).
          Graphemes are important for a number of text operations such as
          sorting or text selection, so it is necessary to be able to compute
          the boundaries between each user-perceived character. Unicode defines
          the default mechanism for computing graphemes in <cite>Unicode
            Standard Annex #29: Text Segmentation</cite> [[!UAX29]] and calls
          this approximation a <dfn>grapheme cluster</dfn>. There are two types
          of default grapheme cluster defined. Unless otherwise noted, grapheme
          cluster in this document refers to an extended default grapheme
          cluster. (A discussion of grapheme clusters is also given in Section 2
           of the <cite>Unicode Standard</cite>, [[!Unicode]]. Cf. near the end of
           <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/ch02.pdf">Section 2.11</a>
           in version 8.0 of The Unicode Standard)</p>
        <p>Because different natural languages have different needs, grapheme clusters
          can also sometimes require tailoring. For example, a Slovak user might
          wish to treat the default pair of grapheme clusters "ch" as a single
          grapheme cluster. Note that the interaction between the language of
          string content and the end-user's preferences might be complex.</p>

      <h2>The String Matching Problem</h2>
      <p>The Web is primarily made up of document formats and protocols based on
        character data. These formats or protocols can be viewed as a set of <a>resources</a> consisting mainly of text files that include some form of structural markup or <a>syntactic content</a>. Processing such syntactic content or document data requires
        string-based operations such as matching (including regular expressions), indexing, searching, sorting,
        and so forth.</p>
      <p>Users, particularly implementers, sometimes have naïve expectations regarding the matching or non-matching
        of similar strings or of the efficacy of different transformations they might apply to text, particularly to
        syntactic content, but including many types of text processing on the Web.</p>
      <p>Because fundamentally the Web is sensitive to the different ways in which text might be represented in a
        document, failing to consider the different ways in which the same text can be represented can confuse 
        users or cause unexpected or frustrating results. In the sections below, this document examines the different
        types of text variation that affect both user perception of text on the Web and the string processing on which
        the Web relies.</p>

        <h3>Case Mapping and Case Folding</h3>
        <p>Some scripts and writing systems make a distinction between UPPER, lower, and Title case characters. Most scripts, including the Brahmic scripts of India, the Arabic script, and the  scripts used to write Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, do not have a case distinction, but some important ones do. Examples of such scripts include the Latin script used in the majority of this document, as well as scripts such as Greek, Armenian, and Cyrillic. </p>
 		
		<p><dfn>Case mapping</dfn> is the process of transforming characters to a specific case, such as UPPER, lower, or Titlecase. For those scripts that have a case distinction, Unicode defines a <em>default</em> UPPER, lower, and Titlecase character mapping for each Unicode code point. Case mapping, at first, appears simple. However there are variations that need to be considered when treating the full range of Unicode in diverse languages.</p>
		
		        
       <aside class="note">
       <p>For more information, see [[!Unicode]] <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/ch05.pdf">Chapter 5</a> in the section titled <em>Case Mappings</em>) for a detailed discussion of case mapping and case folding. </p>
       </aside>  
		
		<aside class="example">

       <p><dfn>Case folding</dfn> is the process of making two texts which differ only in case identical for comparison purposes, that is, it is meant for the purpose of string matching. This is distinct from <a>case mapping</a>, which is primarily meant for display purposes. As with the default case mappings, Unicode defines default case fold mappings ("case folding") for each Unicode code point. Unicode defines two forms of case folding, which we'll examine below.</p>
       
       <p>Since most scripts do not have a case distinction, as with case mappings, most Unicode code points do not require a case folding. For those code points that 
		have a case folding, the majority have a simple, straight-forward mapping to another single matching (generally lowercase) code point. Unicode 
		calls this set of foldings <code class="kw">common</code>, since both types of case folding defined by Unicode includes these.
         </p>
         
         <aside class="example">
         <p>Here are some examples of <code class="kw">common</code> case foldings:</p>
         <table>
           <tr>
			   <td class="exampleChar">A</td>
			   <td>&#x21d2;</td>
			   <td class="exampleChar">a</td>
			   <td><span class="uname">LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A</span> to <span class="uname">LATIN SMALL LETTER A</span></td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
			   <td class="exampleChar">&#x398;</td>
			   <td>&#x21d2;</td>
			   <td class="exampleChar">&#x3b8;</td>
			   <td><span class="uname">GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA</span> to <span class="uname">GREEK SMALL LETTER THETA</span></td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
			   <td class="exampleChar">&#x414;</td>
			   <td>&#x21d2;</td>
			   <td class="exampleChar">&#x434;</td>
			   <td><span class="uname">CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER DE</span> to <span class="uname">CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER DE</span></td>

         </table>
         </aside>
         
         
		  <p>A few characters have a case folding that map one Unicode code point to two or more code points. This set of case foldings are called the <code class="kw">full</code> case foldings. The <code class=kw>full</code> and <code class=kw>common</code> case foldings are used together to provide the default case folding for all of Unicode. We refer to this form of case folding as <dfn>full casefolding</dfn> or <dfn>Unicode full</dfn> in this document.
         </p>
         
         <aside class="example">
          <p>One well-known example of a <code class="kw">full</code> case fold mapping is the character <span class="qchar">&#xdf;</span>
		  <span class="uname" translate="no">U+00DF LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S</span>, a letter that is commonly used in the German language. The <code class="kw">full</code> case folding and the lower case mapping of this character is to two ASCII letters 's'. The upper case mapping is to "SS".
		  </p>
         <table>
           <tr>
			   <td class="exampleChar">&#xdf;</td>
			   <td>&#x21d2;</td>
			   <td class="exampleChar">ss</td>
			   <td><span class="uname">LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S</span> to <span class="uname">LATIN SMALL LETTER S</span> + <span class="uname">LATIN SMALL LETTER S</span></td>
           </tr>
		 </table>
         </aside>
         
		  <p>Because some applications cannot allocate additional storage when performing a case fold operation, Unicode provides a <code class="kw">simple</code> case folding that maps a code point that would normally fold to more or fewer code points to use a single code point for comparison purposes instead. Unlike the full folding, this folding invariably alters the content (and potentially the meaning) of the text. As with <a>full casefolding</a>, the <dfn>simple casefolding</dfn> or <dfn>Unicode simple</dfn> casefold, is a combination of <code class=kw>simple</code> and <code class=kw>common</code> mappings so as to cover the full range of Unicode. <a>Unicode simple</a> is not appropriate for use on the Web. </p>
		  
		  <aside class="example">

		  <p>Examples of <code class=kw>full</code> versus <code class=kw>simple</code> case fold variations can be found in the Greek script, where several precomposed characters have multi-character case foldings. The table below shows one such example, the character <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="el">&#x1F9B;</span> [<span class="uname">U+1F9B GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA WITH DASIA AND VARIA AND PROSGEGRAMMENI</span>]</span> and its <code class="kw">full</code> and <code class="kw">simple</code> case foldings:</p>
					
		  <table style="width: 100%">
     
		     <tr>
			    <td class="exampleChar">&#x1f9b;</td>
			    <td>&#x21d2;</td>

			    <td>&#x21d2;</td>

		     </tr>
		  </table>

		  </aside>
          
        <p>Note that case folding removes information from a string which cannot be recovered later. For example, two <span class="qchar">s</span> letters in German do not necessarily represent  <span class="qchar">&#xdf;</span> in unfolded text.</p>
		
		<section id="caseMappingLanguageSensitivity">
	    <h3>Language Sensitivity</h3>
	    
        <p>Another aspect of case mapping and case folding is that it can be language sensitive.
          Unicode defines <em>default</em> case mappings and case foldings for each encoded character, but
          these are only defaults and are not appropriate in all cases. Some
          languages need case mapping to be tailored to meet specific linguistic
          needs. One example of this are Turkic languages written in the
          Latin script:</p>
          
        <aside class="example">
		  <table>
			  <tr>
				  <th colspan=4>Default Folding</th>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
		     <td class="exampleChar">I</td>
		     <td>&#x21d2;</td>
		     <td class="exampleChar">i</td>
		     <td>Default folding of letter I</td>
		     </tr>
		     <tr>
				  <th colspan=4>Turkic Language Folding</th>
             </tr>
           <tr>
			 <td class="exampleChar">I</td>
		     <td>&#x21d2;</td>
		     <td class="exampleChar">&#x131;</td>
		     <td>Turkic language folding of dotless (ASCII) letter I</td>
		   </tr>
		   <tr>
			 <td class="exampleChar">&#x130;</td>
		     <td>&#x21d2;</td>
		     <td class="exampleChar">i</td>
		     <td>Turkic language folding of dotted letter I</td>
		   </tr>
		  </table>
		  </aside>
			
          <p>While the example above (and this document in general) focuses on case folding for the purpose of matching, note that case mapping is also language-specific. The name of the second largest city in Turkey is "<code>Diyarbakır</code>", which
           contains both the dotted and dotless letters <span class="qchar">i</span>. 
            </p>
            
        <aside class="example">
            <p><span class="exampleChar">Diyarbakır</span> &#x21d2; <code>text-transform: uppercase</code> &#x21d2; <span class="exampleChar">DİYARBAKIR</span></p>
            <p>Notice that the ASCII letter <span class="codepoint"><span lang="tr">&#x0069;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0069 LATIN SMALL LETTER I</span>]</span> maps to <span class="codepoint"><span lang="tr">&#x0130;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0130 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE</span>]</span>, while the letter <span class="codepoint"><span lang="tr">&#x0131;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0131 LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I</span>]</span> maps to the ASCII uppercase <span class="codepoint"><span lang="tr">&#x0049;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0049 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I</span>]</span>. Failure to apply this localized case mapping would change the meaning of the text in Turkish, even though this is the expected mapping in other languages, such as English or German.</p>
            <p>This language-specific tailoring can also be applied to case folding. For example, if the uppercase text needed to be matched against some set of strings in a case-insensitive way:</p>
            <p><span class="exampleChar">D&#x130;YARBAKIR</span> &#x21d2; <code>case fold</code> &#x21d2; <span class="exampleChar">diyarbak&#x131;r</span></p>

        </section>
        
        <section id="caseFoldApplication">
	    <h3>Uses for Case Folding</h3>
	    
          <p>Some document formats or protocols seek to aid interoperability or provide an aid to content authors by ignoring case variations in the <a data-lt="vocabulary">vocabulary</a> they define or in <a>user-supplied values</a> permitted by the format or protocol.</p>
          
          <aside class="example">
			  
		<p>One example where this occurs is when matching element names between an HTML document and its associated style sheet. Consider this HTML fragment: </p>
<pre>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;

  SPAN.hello {
     text-decoration: underline;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;span class="hello"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/span&gt;
</pre>

        <p>The <code class="kw" translate="no">SPAN</code> in the stylesheet
          matches the <code class="kw" translate="no">span</code> element in the 
		document, even though the stylesheet uses uppercase and the HTML markup 
		does not.</p>
</aside>
        
        
        <p>Sometimes case can vary in a way that is not semantically meaningful
          or is not fully under the user's control. This is particularly true
          when searching a document, but may sometimes also apply
          when defining rules for matching user- or content-generated values,
          such as identifiers. In these situations, case-<em>in</em>sensitive
          matching might be desirable instead.</p>
          
        <p>When defining a <a>vocabulary</a>, one important consideration is whether the values are restricted to the ASCII [[ASCII]] subset of Unicode or if the vocabulary permits the use of characters (such as accents on Latin letters or a broad range of Unicode including non-Latin scripts) that potentially have more complex case folding requirements. To address these different requirements, there are four types of casefold matching defined by this document for the purposes of string identity matching in document formats or protocols:</p>
        
        <p id="case-sensitive"><dfn data-lt="case-sensitive">Case sensitive matching</dfn>: code points are compared directly with no case folding.</p>
        
        <p id="aci"><dfn data-lt="ASCII case-insensitive|ASCII case-insensitive matching">ASCII case-insensitive matching</dfn> is <a href="https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive">defined</a> in [[INFRA]]. This definition compares two sequences of code points as if all ASCII code points in the range 0x41 to 0x5A (A to Z) were mapped to the corresponding code points in the range 0x61 to 0x7A (a to z). ASCII case-insensitive matching can be required when a <a>vocabulary</a> is itself constrained to ASCII.</p>

        </aside>
        
        <p>Because applications need to find the semantic equivalence in texts
          that use different code point sequences, Unicode defines a means of
          making two semantically equivalent texts identical: the Unicode
          Normalization Forms [[!UAX15]].</p>
		  <aside class="addition">
		  <div class="note-title marker"><span>Note Well</span></div>
		  <p>Unicode Normalization does not guarantee that two

		</aside>
        <p><a>Resources</a> are often susceptible to the effects of these variations because their specifications and implementations on the Web do not require Unicode Normalization of the text, nor do they take into consideration the string matching algorithms used when processing the <a>syntactic content</a> (including <a>user-supplied values</a>) and <a>localizable content</a> later. For this reason, content developers need to ensure that they have provided a consistent representation in order to avoid problems later.</p>
        
        <p>However, it can be difficult for users to assure that a given <a>resource</a>
          or set of resources uses a consistent textual representation because
          the differences are usually not visible when viewed as text. Tools and
          implementations thus need to consider the difficulties experienced by
          users when visually or logically equivalent strings that "ought to"
          match (in the user's mind) are considered to be distinct values.
          Providing a means for users to see these differences and/or normalize
          them as appropriate makes it possible for end users to avoid failures
          that spring from invisible differences in their source documents. For
          example, the W3C Validator warns when an HTML document is not fully in
          Unicode Normalization Form C.</p>

          <h4>Canonical vs. Compatibility Equivalence</h4>
          <p>Unicode defines two types of equivalence between characters: <em>canonical equivalence</em> and <em>compatibility equivalence</em>.</p>
          <p><dfn>Canonical equivalence</dfn> is a fundamental equivalency between Unicode code points or sequences of Unicode code points that represent the same abstract character. Canonically equivalent sequences ideally should have the same visual appearance (although there are many factors that can cause them to appear somewhat differently) and they should be treated and processed as if they were identical. Unicode defines a process called <em>canonical decomposition</em> that removes these primary distinctions between two differently-encoded but canonically equivalent texts.</p>
          <p>Examples of canonical equivalence defined by Unicode include:</p>
          <ul class="dropExampleList">
            <li class="dropExampleItem"><span class="dropExample">Ç<span style="font-size:75%">
                  vs.</span>C&#x0327;</span> <em>Precomposed versus combining
                sequences.</em> Some characters can be composed from a base
              character followed by one or more combining characters. The same
              characters are sometimes also encoded as a distinct "precomposed"
              character. In this example, the character <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x00C7;</span> [<span class="uname">U+00C7 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA</span>]</span> is canonically equivalent to the character sequence starting with the base character <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x0043;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0043 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C</span>]</span> followed by <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x25CC;&#x0327;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0327 COMBINING CEDILLA​</span>]</span>. Such equivalence can extend to characters with multiple combining marks.</li>
            <li class="dropExampleItem"><span class="dropExample">q&#x0307;&#x0323;<span style="font-size:75%">
                  vs.</span>q&#x0323;&#x0307;</span> <em>Order of combining marks.</em> When a base character is modified by multiple combining marks, the order of the combining marks might not represent a distinct character. Here the sequence <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x0071;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0071 LATIN SMALL LETTER Q</span>]</span> <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&nbsp;&#x0307;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0307 COMBINING DOT ABOVE​</span>]</span> <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&nbsp;&#x0323;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0323 COMBINING DOT BELOW​</span>]</span> and <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x0071;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0071 LATIN SMALL LETTER Q</span>]</span> <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&nbsp;&#x0323;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0323 COMBINING DOT BELOW​</span>]</span> <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&nbsp;&#x0307;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0307 COMBINING DOT ABOVE​</span>]</span> are equivalent, even though the combining marks are in a different order. Note that this example is chosen carefully: the dot-above character and dot-below character are on opposite "sides" of the base character. The order of combining diacritics on the same side often has a positional meaning (although there are cases where the order doesn't matter to the presentation).</li>
            <li class="dropExampleItem"><span class="dropExample">&#x2126;<span style="font-size:75%">
                  vs.</span>&#x03a9;</span> <em>Singleton mappings.</em> These result from the need to separately encode otherwise equivalent characters to support legacy character encodings. In this example, the Ohm symbol <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x2126;</span> [<span class="uname">U+2126 OHM SYMBOL</span>]</span> is canonically equivalent (and identical in appearance) to the Greek letter Omega <span class="codepoint"><span lang="el">&#x03A9;</span> [<span class="uname">U+03A9 GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA</span>]</span>. (Another example of a singleton is <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x212B;</span> [<span class="uname">U+212B ANGSTROM SIGN</span>]</span> in the <a href="#aringExample">encoding variations example</a> above)</li>
            <li class="dropExampleItem"><span class="dropExample">&#xac00;<span style="font-size:75%">
                  vs.</span>&#x1100;&#x1161;</span> <em>Hangul.</em> The Hangul script is
              used to write the Korean language. This script is constructed
              logically, with each syllable being a roughly-square <a>grapheme</a>
              formed from specific sub-parts that represent consonants and
              vowels. These specific sub-parts, called <em>jamo</em>, are
              encoded in Unicode. So too are the precomposed syllables. Thus the
              syllable <span class="codepoint"><span lang="ko">&#xAC00;</span> [<span class="uname">U+AC00 [Hangul Syllable, First]</span>]</span> is canonically equivalent to its constituent <em>jamo</em> characters <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="ko">&#x1100;&#x1161;</span> [<span class="uname">U+1100 HANGUL CHOSEONG KIYEOK</span> + <span class="uname">U+1161 HANGUL JUNGSEONG A</span>]</span>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><dfn>Compatibility equivalence</dfn> is a weaker equivalence
            between Unicode characters or sequences of Unicode characters that represent the
            same abstract character, but may have a different visual appearance
            or behavior. Generally the process called <em>compatibility decomposition</em> removes
            formatting variations, such as superscript, subscript, rotated,
            circled, and so forth, but other variations also occur. In many
            cases, characters with compatibility decompositions represent a
            distinction of a semantic nature; replacing the use of distinct
            characters with their compatibility decomposition can therefore
            change the meaning of the text. Texts that are equivalent after 
		  compatibility decomposition often were not perceived as being 
		  identical beforehand and SHOULD NOT be treated as equivalent by a formal
            language.</p>

          <p>In the above table, it is important to note that the characters
            illustrated are <em>actual Unicode codepoints</em>, not just presentational
            variations due to context or style. Each character was
            encoded into Unicode for compatibility with various legacy character
            encodings. They should not be confused with the normal kinds of
            presentational processing used on their non-compatibility
            counterparts.</p>
          <p>For example, most Arabic-script text uses the characters in the Arabic script block of Unicode (starting at <span class="uname" translate="no">U+0600</span>). The actual glyphs used to display the text are selected using fonts and text processing logic based on the position inside a word (initial, medial, final, or isolated), in a process called "shaping". In the table above, the four presentation forms of the Arabic letter <span class="codepoint"><span lang="ar" dir="rtl">&#x0647;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0647 ARABIC LETTER HEH</span>]</span> are shown. The characters shown are compatibility characters in the <span class="uname" translate="no">U+FE00</span> block, each of which represents a specific "positional" shape and each of the four code points shown have a compatibility decomposition to the <span class="quote">regular</span> Arabic letter <span class="codepoint"><span lang="ar" dir=rtl>&#x0647;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0647 ARABIC LETTER HEH</span>]</span>. These presentation forms are intended only for the support of round-trip encoding conversions with the <a>legacy character encodings</a> that include equivalent presentation forms. Otherwise a string containing a sequence of letters 'heh' is just encoded as a series of <span class=uname translate=no>U+0647</span> code points, with the rendering system and font supplying the appropriate shapes.
          <aside class=example id=bidiCompatibilityExample>
			  <p>Example of a sequence of <span class=uname translate=no>U+0647 ARABIC LETTER HEH</span>. The different letter shapes are provided by the rendering system. Note that Arabic is read from right-to-left, so the "isolated" shape is on the right side of the string (followed by a space), then "initial", "medial", and "final" shapes.</p>

          </aside>
          <p>Similarly, the variations in half-width and full-width forms and rotated
            characters (for use in vertical text) are encoded as separate code
            points, mainly for compatibility with legacy character encodings. In 
		  many cases these variations are associated with the Unicode properties 
		  described in <cite>East Asian Width</cite> [[UAX11]]. See also <cite>Unicode 
		  Vertical Text Layout</cite> [[UTR50]] for a discussion of vertical text 
		  presentation forms.</p>
          <p>In the case of characters with compatibility decompositions, such
            as those shown above, the <span class="qchar">K</span> Unicode
            Normalization forms convert the text to the "normal" or "expected"
            Unicode code point. But the existence of these compatibility
            characters cannot be taken to imply that similar appearance
            variations produced in the normal course of text layout and
            presentation are affected by Unicode Normalization. They are not.</p>

          <h4>Composition vs. Decomposition</h4>
          <p>These two types of Unicode-defined equivalence are then grouped by another pair of variations: "decomposition" and "composition". In "decomposition", separable logical parts of a visual character are broken out into a sequence of base characters and combining marks and the resulting code points are put into a fixed, canonical order. In "composition", the decomposition is performed and then combining marks are recombined according to certain rules with their base characters.</p>
          <div class="warning">
            <p>Roughly speaking, <abbr title="Normalization Form C">NFC</abbr> is defined such that each combining character sequence (a base character followed by one or more combining characters) is replaced, as far as possible, by a canonically equivalent precomposed character.</p>
            
            <p>It is rather important to notice what this does <strong>not</strong> mean. The resulting character sequence can still contain combining marks, since not all character sequences have a precomposed equivalent. Indeed, as we've seen, many scripts offer no alternative to the use of combining marks, such as the Devanagari vowels in <a href="#graphemeExample">this example</a>. In other cases, a given base character and combining mark is not replaced with a precomposed character because the combination is blocked by normalization rules. For example, some Indic scripts do not compose certain sequences of base plus diacritic, even though a matching precomposed character exists, due to composition exclusion rules. Composition may also be blocked by another combining mark between the two characters that would otherwise combine.</p>

        <section id="normalization_forms">
          <h4>Unicode Normalization Forms</h4>

			  <li><strong>D</strong> (or NFD) stands for <em>canonical Decomposition</em>.</li>
			  <li><strong>C</strong> (or NFC) stands for <em>Composition</em>, which is canonical decomposition followed by composition.</li>

           <p>Unicode Normalization reduces these (and other potential sequences
            of escapes representing the same character) to just three possible
            variations. However, Unicode Normalization doesn't remove all
            textual distinctions and sometimes the application of Unicode
            Normalization can remove meaning that is distinctive or meaningful
            in a given context. For example: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Not all compatibility characters have a compatibility
              decomposition.</li>
            <li>Some characters that look alike or have similar semantics are actually distinct in Unicode and don't have canonical or compatibility decompositions to link them together. For example, <span class="codepoint"><span lang="zh">&#x3002;</span> [<span class="uname">U+3002 IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP</span>]</span> is used as a <span class="quote">period</span> at the end of sentences in languages such as Chinese or Japanese. However, it is not considered equivalent to the ASCII <span class="quote">period</span> character <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x002E;</span> [<span class="uname">U+002E FULL STOP</span>]</span>.</li>
            <li>Some character variations are not handled by the Unicode
              Normalization Forms. For example, UPPER, Title, and lowercase
              variations are a separate and distinct textual variation that must
              be separately handled when comparing text.</li>
            <li>Compatibility normalization removes meaning. For example, the character sequence <span class="qterm"><samp>8&#xbd;</samp></span> (including the character <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x00BD;</span> [<span class="uname">U+00BD VULGAR FRACTION ONE HALF</span>]</span>), when normalized using one of the <span class="quote">compatibility</span> normalization forms (that is, <code>NFKD</code> or <code>NFKC</code>), becomes an ASCII character sequence: <samp>81/2</samp>.</li>

         <h3>Identical-Appearing Characters and the Limitations of Normalization</h3>
         <p>Many users are surprised to find that two identical-looking strings&mdash;including
         those that have had a specific Unicode normalization form applied&mdash;might not 
         in fact use the same underlying <a>Unicode code points</a>. This includes strings that have
         had the more-destructive <code>NFKC</code> and <code>NFKD</code> compatibility normalization
         forms applied to them. Even when strings, tokens, or identifiers appear visually to be the same, 
         they can be encoded differently.</p>
         
   		  <p>The Unicode canonical normalization forms are concerned with folding the multiple different code point sequences that can be used for a given abstract character or grapheme cluster to use the same code point sequence. However, logically distinct characters or grapheme clusters can still look the same or very similar. When a pair of <a>graphemes</a> look identical (or very similar), they are called <dfn data-lt="homograph|homographs">homographs</dfn>. When a pair of graphemes look similar or are <a>homographs</a> but actually represent logically different characters or character sequences, they are said to be <q><dfn>confusable</dfn></q>.</p>

		    but they are encoded separately, as they are logically distinct parts of their respective Greek, Cyrillic, or Latin alphabet. Unicode Normalization will not fold these characters together.</p>
		  </aside>

		  <p>Examples of identical or identical-seeming appearance can appear even within a single script. This can take the form of similarly shaped characters, such as "0" and "O" or "l" and "1". But other scripts or the use of different compatibility characters can present much less readily distinguished variations. In some cases, Unicode Normalization brings these together, but in many other cases it does not.

		  <p>In addition to identical or similar-appearing characters, the opposite problem also exists: 
		  Unicode Normalization, even the <code>NFKC</code> and <code>NFKD</code> Compatibility forms,
		    does not bring together characters that have the same intrinsic meaning or function
		    but which vary in appearance or usage. For example, <code>U+002E</code> (.) 
		    and <code>U+3002</code> (&#x3002;) both function as sentence ending punctuation, 
		    but the distinction is not removed by normalization because the characters have a distinct identity.

		<p>When matching strings in a case-insensitive manner, one complication is that the case folding process can produce strings that are not normalized, even if the original string was normalized.

		<p>More commonly, though, the connection between normalization and case folding has to do with ensuring that strings which use combining marks reorder or recombine in the same way for comparison purposes:</p>

		<p>The Unicode canonical normalization forms (NFC or NFD) and case folding, when used together, are closed: once a string has been case folded and then had NFD or NFC applied to it, further applications of the same case folding or Unicode normalization form do not result in a different string.</p>
		
		<p>When comparing strings for <a>compatibility equivalence</a> between characters (in other words, the NFKC/NFKD forms), the case fold-and-normalize operation must be performed twice because the compatibility decomposition step can result in characters that need to be case folded and the subsequent case fold can result in a sequence that must then be normalized.</p>

			<h4>Why does Normalization precede Case folding?</h4>
			
			<p>Unicode's definitions of <strong>canonical casefold matching</strong> (rule <code>[D145]</code>) and <strong>compatibility casefold matching</strong> (rule <code>[D146]</code>) include multiple normalization steps. This increases the complexity and cost of performing caseless matching. The initial case fold step, before performing case folding, addresses a specific corner case, which is detailed in this section.</p>
			
			<p>The concluding normalization step in Unicode's casefold matching processes exists to ensure that the resulting strings are in a specific Unicode normalization form. If the resulting case folded strings are to be stored or displayed to the user, it is a good practice to ensure that denormalized sequences produced by the case fold operation are renormalized for display. However, this step is OPTIONAL in the <a href="#CanonicalFoldNormalizationStep">Unicode Canonical Case Fold Normalization Step</a> and the <a href="#CompatibilityFoldNormalizationStep">Unicode Compatibility Case Fold Normalization Step</a>, since performing an additional normalization won't change the results of a string comparison.</p>
			
			<p>Sixty-three Greek precomposed characters have a decomposition mapping (i.e. normalize to form NFD) that contains the character &nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="el">&#x0345;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0345 COMBINING GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI</span>]</span>, a diacritical mark representing a subscripted iota (referred to as a <em>prosgegrammei</em> or <em>ypogegrammeni</em>). This mark represents an orthographic form found in ancient or classical Greek for a sound not present in more modern forms of the language. The uppercase and titlecase mappings of these characters separate this combining mark as the separate, base, letter <code>iota</code>. For consistency with title/uppercase mappings, the case fold mapping of these characters therefore contains <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="el">&#x03B9;</span> [<span class="uname">U+03B9 GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA</span>]</span> (<a href="#definitionCaseFolding">recall</a> that Unicode case fold is generally to lower case).</p>
			
			<p>If and only if one of these 63 characters is followed by a combining mark, failing to apply canonical decomposition before case folding can result in potential comparison mismatches. Such character sequences are not in a normalized form and are difficult to produce "naturally" (through keyboards and other input processes).</p>
		
    		<p>For example, if one starts with the precomposed (NFC) character <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="el">&#x1F8C;</span> [<span class="uname">U+1F8C GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI AND OXIA AND PROSGEGRAMMENI</span>]</span> (which is the most common way to represent this combination of base and diacritic characters) and just runs case fold transformations one ends up with: <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="el">&#x1F04;&#x03B9;</span> [<span class="uname">U+1F04 GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH PSILI AND OXIA</span> + <span class="uname">U+03B9 GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA</span>]</span>.</p>

This produces a sequence that can't be normalised to match the others (and is actually incorrect, as it has a different meaning than the original user-perceived character.)</p>

      <section id="characterEscapes">
        <h3>Character Escapes and Includes</h3>
        <p>Most document formats or protocols provide an escaping mechanism to
          permit the inclusion of characters that are otherwise difficult to
          input, process, or encode. These escaping mechanisms provide an
          additional equivalent means of representing characters inside a given
          resource. They also allow for the encoding of Unicode characters not
          represented in the character encoding scheme used by the document.</p>
          
        <p class="note">For further discussion of character escapes, including guidelines for the definition of escaping mechanisms in specifications, see: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#sec-Escaping">Section 4.6</a> of [[!CHARMOD]].</p>
        
        <div class="note">
              <p>The expansion of character escapes and includes is dependent on context, that is, on which <a href="#def_syntactic_content" class="termref">syntactic content</a> or programming language is considered to apply when the string matching operation is performed. Consider a search for the string <span class="qterm">suçon</span> in an XML document containing <code>su&amp;#xE7;on</code> but not <code>suçon</code>. If the search is performed in a plain text editor, the context is <span class="new-term">plain text</span> (no <a href="#def_syntactic_content" class="termref">syntactic content</a> or programming language applies), the <code class="kw">&amp;#xE7;</code> character escape is not recognized, hence not expanded and the search fails. If the search is performed in an XML browser, the context is <code>XML</code>, the character escape (defined by XML) is expanded and the search succeeds. </p>
              <p>An intermediate case would be an XML editor that <em>purposefully</em>
                provides a view of an XML document with entity references left
                unexpanded. In that case, a search over that pseudo-XML view
                will deliberately <em>not</em> expand entities: in that
                particular context, entity references are not considered
                includes and need not be expanded</p>
            </div>
        

        <p>For example, <span class="qchar">€</span> <span class="uname" translate="no">U+20AC
            EURO SIGN</span> can also be encoded in HTML as the hexadecimal
          entity <code>&amp;#x20ac;</code> or as the decimal entity <code>&amp;#8364;</code>.
          In a JavaScript or JSON file, it can appear as <code>\u20ac</code> or as <code>\u{20AC}</code>
          while in a CSS stylesheet it can appear as <code>\20ac</code>. All of
          these representations encode the same literal character value: <span class="qchar">€</span>.</p>
        <p>Character escapes are normally interpreted before a document is
          processed and strings within the format or protocol are matched.
          Returning to an example we used above: </p>
<aside class="example">
        <pre>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;

  span.h\e9llo {
      text-decoration:underline;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;span class="h&amp;#xe9;llo"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/span&gt;
</pre>
</aside>
        <p>You would expect that text to display like the following: <span class="héllo">Hello world!</span></p>
        
        <p>In order for this to work, the user-agent (browser) had to match two strings representing the class name <code>h&#xe9;llo</code>, even though the CSS and HTML each used a different escaping mechanism. The above fragment demonstrates one way that text can vary and still be considered "the same" according to a specification: the class name <code>h\e9llo</code> matched the class name in the HTML mark-up <code>h&amp;#xe9;llo</code> (and would also match the literal value <code>héllo</code> using the code point <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x00E9;</span> [<span class="uname">U+00E9 LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE</span>]</span>).</p>
        
        <p>Formal languages and document formats often offer facilities for including a piece of text from one resource inside another. An <dfn data-lt="include|includes">include</dfn> is a mechanism for inserting content into the body of a <a>resource</a>. Include mechanisms import content into a resource at processing time. This affects the structure of the document and potentially matching against the vocabulary of the document. Examples of includes are entity references in XML, the XInclude [[XInclude]] specification, and @import rules in CSS.</p>
        
        <p>An include is said to be <dfn>include normalized</dfn> if it does not begin with a combining mark (either in the form of a character escape or as a character literal in the included resource).</p>

      <section id="invisibleCharacters">
        <h3>Invisible Unicode Characters</h3>
        <p>Unicode provides a number of special-purpose characters 
		that help document authors control the appearance or performance of 
		text. Because many of these characters are invisible or do not have keyboard equivalents, users are not always aware 
		of their presence or absence. As a result, these characters can interfere with string matching when they are part of the encoded 
		character sequence but the expected matching text does not also include them. Some examples of these characters include:</p>
          
        <p>The Unicode control characters <span class="uname" translate="no">U+200D Zero Width Joiner</span> (also known 
        as <em>ZWJ</em>) and <span class="uname" translate="no">U+200C Zero Width Non-Joiner</span> (also known as 
		  <em>ZWNJ</em>). 
		While these characters can be used to control ligature formation&mdash;either preventing the formation of undesirable 
		ligatures or encouraging the formation of desirable ones&mdash;their primary use is to control 
		  the joining and shape selection in complex scripts such as the Arabic or various of the Indic scripts. 
		  Some Indic scripts use the ZWJ and ZWNJ characters to allow authors to control the shape that certain conjuncts take. See the 
		  discussion in Chapter 12 of [[!Unicode]].</p>
		  
		<p>The <span class="uname" translate="no">Zero Width Non-Joiner</span> is used in Persian to 
		  prevent certain "normal" Arabic script joining. In these cases, the presence or absence of the
		  character <em>does</em> affect the meaning. For example, the word تنها ("alone") and the word تن‌ها&nbsp; ("bodies" 
		  or "corpuses") are encoded as "<span class="uname">U+062A 
		  U+0646 U+0647 U+0627</span>" and "<span class="uname">U+062A U+0646 
			  <span style="text-decoration:underline">U+200C</span> U+0647 U+0627</span>" 
		  respectively, the only difference being the ZWNJ in the latter word.</p>

		  <p>The ZWJ character is also used in forming certain emoji sequences, which is discussed in more
		  detail <a href="#emojiSequences">below</a>.</p>

		  <p id="variationSelectors">Variation selectors (<span class="uname">U+FE00</span> through 
		  <span class="uname" translate="no">U+FE0F</span>) are 
        characters used to select an alternate appearance or glyph 
        (see Character Model: Fundamentals [[CHARMOD]]). For example, they are used to select between black-and-white and color emoji. 
        These are also used in predefined ideographic variation sequences (<span class="qterm">IVS</span>). Many
        examples are given in the "Standardized Variants" portion of the Unicode Character Database (UCD).</p>
		  <p>A few scripts also provide a way to encode visual variation selection: a prominent example of this 
		  are the Mongolian script's free variation selectors (<span class="uname">U+180B</span> through 
		  <span class="uname" translate="no">U+180D</span>). </p>
		  <p>The character <span class="uname" translate="no">U+034F Combining Grapheme Joiner</span>, 
		  whose name is misleading (as it does not join graphemes), is used to separate characters that might otherwise be 
		  considered a grapheme for the purposes of sorting or to provide a 
		  means of maintaining certain textual distinctions when applying Unicode 
		  normalization to text. </p>
		  <p>Whitespace variations can also affect the interpretation and 
		  matching of text. For example, the various non-breaking space 
		  characters, such as NBSP, NNBSP, etc.</p>
		  <p><span class="uname" translate="no">U+200B Zero Width Space</span> is a character used to 
		  indicate word boundaries in text where spaces do not otherwise appear. 
		  For example, it might be used in a Thai language document to assist 
		  with word-breaking. </p>
		  <p>The <span class="uname" translate="no">U+00AD Soft Hyphen</span> can be used in text to indicate a potential or preferred hyphenation position. It only 
		  becomes visible when the text is reflowed to wrap at that position.</p>
		  
		  <p>The <span class="uname" translate="no">U+2060 WORD JOINER</span>, sometimes called <em>WJ</em>, is a zero-width non-breaking space character. Its purpose is to prevent line breaks between two characters. Except for purposes of line-breaking, it should be ignored. It serves as a replacement for the character <span class="uname" translate="no">U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE</span> because <span class=uname translate=no>U+FEFF</span> is more commonly known as the "Byte Order Mark" (BOM). A byte order mark is used at the start of some plain text files to signal that the file is in a Unicode character encoding. </p>

        <p>Finally, most scripts, when written horizontally, proceed from left-to-right. However, some scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, are written predominantly from right-to-left. Texts can be written in a mix of these scripts or include character sequences, such as numbers or quotes in another script, that run in the opposite direction to other parts of the text. This intermixing of text direction is called <em>bidirectional</em> text or <q>bidi</q> for short. The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm [[UAX9]] describes how such mixed-direction text is processed for display. For most text, the directional handling can be derived from the text itself. However, there are many cases in which the algorithm needs additional information in order to present text correctly. For more examples, see [[html-bidi]].</p>

        <p>One of the ways that Unicode defines to address the ambiguity of text direction are a set of invisible control characters to
        mark the start and end of directional runs. While bidirectional controls can have an affect on the appearance of the text
        (since they help the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm with the presentation of text), they might have no effect on the
        text if the text would naturally have fallen into bidirectional runs without the controls. Because these controls are, like the characters mentioned above, invisible, they can have an unintentional effect on matching.
        </p>

	  <p>In almost all of these cases, users may not be aware of or cannot 
	  be sure if a given document or text string has included or omitted one 
	  of these characters. Because text matching depends on matching the 
	  underlying codepoints, variation in the encoding of the text due to 
	  these markers can cause matches that ought to succeed to mysteriously 
	  fail (from the point of view of the user).</p>

      <section id="emojiSequences">
      <h3>Emoji Sequences</h3>   
      <p>A newer feature of Unicode are the emoji characters. In [[UTR51]], Unicode describes these as:</p>   

      <p class="quote">Emoji are pictographs (pictorial symbols) that are typically presented in a colorful cartoon 
         form and used inline in text. They represent things such as faces, weather, vehicles and buildings, 
         food and drink, animals and plants, or icons that represent emotions, feelings, or activities.</p>

      <p>Emoji can be used with a variety of emoji modifiers, including <span class="uname">U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER</span> or <dfn>ZWJ</dfn>, to form more complex emoji.</p>
      
      <p>For example, the emoji (<span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x1F46A;</span> [<span class="uname">U+1F46A FAMILY</span>]</span>) can also be formed by using ZWJ between emoji characters in the sequence <span class="uname">U+1F468 <span style="text-decoration:underline">U+200D</span> U+1F469 <span style="text-decoration:underline">U+200D</span> U+1F466</span>.
		  Altering or adding other emoji characters can alter the composition of the family. For example the sequence 
		  <span class="uname" translate="no">&#x1f468;&#x200d;&#x1f469;&#x200d;&#x1f467;&#x200d;&#x1f467; 
		  U+1F468 U+200D U+1F469 U+200D U+1F467 U+200D U+1F467</span> results in a composed
		  emoji character for a "family: man, woman, girl, girl" on systems that support this kind of 
		  composition. Many common emoji can <em>only</em> be formed using ZWJ sequences. For more 
		  information, see [[UTR51]].</p>
		  
	  <p>Emoji characters can be followed by emoji modifier characters. These modifiers allow for the selection of skin tones for emoji that represent people. These characters are normally invisible modifiers that follow the base emoji that they modify. For example: &#x1f468;&nbsp;&#x1f468;&#x1f3fb;&nbsp;&#x1f468;&#x1f3fc;&nbsp;&#x1f468;&#x1f3fd;&nbsp;&#x1f468;&#x1f3fe;&nbsp;&#x1f468;&#x1f3ff;</p>
	     
	  <p>An emoji character can also be followed by a <a href="#variationSelectors">variation
	     selector</a> to indicate text (black and white, indicated by 
	     <span class="uname">U+FE0E Variation Selector 15</span>) or color 
	     (indicated by <span class="uname">U+FE0F Variation Selector 16</span>) presentation
	     of the base emoji.</p>
	  
	  <p>Still another wrinkle in the use of emoji are flags. National flags can be composed using country codes derived from the [[BCP47]] registry, such as the sequence <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x1F1FF;</span> [<span class="uname">U+1F1FF REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER Z</span>]</span> <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x1F1F2;</span> [<span class="uname">U+1F1F2 REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER M</span>]</span>, which is the country code (<kbd>ZM</kbd>) for the country Zambia: &#x1f1ff;&#x1f1f2;. Other regional or special purpose flags can be composed using a flag emoji with various symbols or with regional indicator codes terminating in a cancel tag. For example, the flag of Scotland (🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿) can be composed like this: </p>
	  <ul>
		  <li><span class="codepoint"><span lang="ang">&#x1F3F4;</span> [<span class="uname">U+1F3F4 WAVING BLACK FLAG</span>]</span>
		  <li><span class="codepoint"><span lang="ang">&#xE0067;</span> [<span class="uname">U+E0067 TAG LATIN SMALL LETTER G</span>]</span> 
		  <li><span class="codepoint"><span lang="ang">&#xE0062;</span> [<span class="uname">U+E0062 TAG LATIN SMALL LETTER B</span>]</span>
		  <li><span class="codepoint"><span lang="ang">&#xE0073;</span> [<span class="uname">U+E0073 TAG LATIN SMALL LETTER S</span>]</span> 
		  <li><span class="codepoint"><span lang="ang">&#xE0063;</span> [<span class="uname">U+E0063 TAG LATIN SMALL LETTER C</span>]</span> 
		  <li><span class="codepoint"><span lang="ang">&#xE0074;</span> [<span class="uname">U+E0074 TAG LATIN SMALL LETTER T</span>]</span> 
		  <li><span class="codepoint"><span lang="ang">&#xE007F;</span> [<span class="uname">U+E007F CANCEL TAG</span>]</span>
      </ul>
	  
 	  <p>Each of these mechanisms can be used together, so quite complex sequences of characters can be used to form a single emoji grapheme or image. Even very similar emoji sequences might not use the same exact encoded sequence. In most cases the modifiers and combinations mentioned above are generated by the end-user's keyboard (where they are presented as a single emoji "character"). This diversity of encoding options is partially addressed to the extent that different vendors use only (and exactly) the sequences that are "recommended for interchange" by Unicode. This helps vendors ensure that fonts and keyboards are prepared to give users the options they expect. Still, users generally won't be aware of the underlying encoding complexity and generative mechanisms are not limited to those that are recommended. Emoji sequences are evolving rapidly, so there could be additional developments to either help or hinder matching of emoji in the near future. Unicode normalization does not reorder these sequences or insert or remove any of the modifiers. Users and implementers are therefore cautioned that users who employ emoji characters in namespaces and other matching contexts can easily encounter unexpected "character" mismatches due to variations in encoding.</p>

        <h3>Legacy Character Encodings</h3>
        <p><a>Resources</a> can use different character encoding
          schemes, including <a>legacy character encodings</a>, to serialize
          document formats on the Web. Each character encoding scheme uses
          different byte values and sequences to represent a given subset of the
          Universal Character Set.</p>
        <div class="note">
          <p><strong>Choosing a Unicode character encoding, such as UTF-8, for all documents, formats, and protocols is a strongly encouraged <a href="#convertingToCommonUnicodeForm">recommendation</a></strong>, since there is no additional utility to be gained from using a legacy character encoding and the considerations in the rest of this section would be completely avoided.</p>
        </div>
        <p>For example, <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x20AC;</span> [<span class="uname">U+20AC EURO SIGN</span>]</span> is encoded as the byte sequence <code>0xE2.82.AC</code>
          in the <code class="kw">UTF-8</code> character encoding. This same
          character is encoded as the byte sequence <code>0x80</code> in the
          legacy character encoding <code class="kw">windows-1252</code>.
          (Other legacy character encodings may not provide any byte sequence to
          encode the character.)</p>
        <p>Specifications mainly address these resulting variations by
          considering each document to be a sequence of Unicode characters after
          converting from the document's character encoding (be it a legacy
          character encoding or a Unicode encoding such as UTF-8) and then
          unescaping any character escapes before proceeding to process the
          document.</p>
        <p class="note">Even within a single legacy character encoding there can
          be variations in implementation. One famous example is the legacy
          Japanese encoding <code class="kw">Shift_JIS</code>. Different
          transcoder implementations faced choices about how to map specific
          byte sequences to Unicode. So the byte sequence <code>0x80.60</code>
          (<code>0x2141</code> in the JIS X 0208 character set) was mapped by
          some implementations to <span class="uname" translate="no">U+301C
            WAVE DASH</span> while others chose <span class="uname" translate="no">U+FF5E
            FULL WIDTH TILDE</span>. This means that two reasonable,
          self-consistent, transcoders could produce different Unicode character
          sequences from the same input. The <cite>Encoding</cite> [[Encoding]]
          specification exists, in part, to ensure that Web implementations use
          interoperable and identical mappings. However, there is no guarantee
          that transcoders consistent with the Encoding specification will be
          applied to documents found on the Web or used to process data
          appearing in a particular document format or protocol.</p>
        <p>One additional consideration in converting to Unicode is the existence of
           legacy character encodings of bidirectional scripts (such as Hebrew and Arabic) that use a
           visual storage order. That is, unlike Unicode and other modern encodings,
           the characters are stored in memory in the order that they are printed
           on the screen from left-to-right (as with a line printer). When converting
           these encodings to Unicode or when comparing text in these encodings, care
           must be taken to place both the source and target text into logical order.

      <h2>String Matching of Syntactic Content in Document Formats and Protocols</h2>
      
      <p>In the Web environment, where strings can use different character encodings, use different character sequences within those encodings, and have other variations (such as case) described in this document, it's important to establish a consistent process for evaluating string identity.</p>
        
      <p>This chapter defines the requirements for specifying and implementing string matching in <a href="#def_syntactic_content" class="termref">syntactic content</a>.</p>
      
      <section id="specifying-content-restrictions">
		  <h2>Specifying Content Restrictions</h2>
		  
		  <p>One of the ways in which string matching can be made more effective and consistent is by applying restrictions to the content that is to be matched. The definition of a <a>vocabulary</a>, especially one that permits <a>user-supplied values</a> within that vocabulary, necessarily includes the rules for what makes a "valid identifier". This usually includes length and content restrictions. Some best practices for defining these restrictions include the following:</p>
		  
		  <div class="req spec" id="charmod_content_surrogates">
          <p class="advisement">Specifications SHOULD NOT allow surrogate code points (<span class=uname>U+D800</span> to <span class=uname>U+DFFF</span>) or non-character code points in identifiers.</p>
          </div>
		  
		  <div class="req spec" id="charmod_content_controls">
		  <p class="advisement">Specifications SHOULD NOT allow the <code>C0</code> (<span class=uname>U+0000</span> to <span class=uname>U+001F</span>) and <code>C1</code> (<span class=uname>U+0080</span> to <span class=uname>U+009F</span>) control characters in identifiers.</p>
          </div>
		  
		  <p>There are two broad classes of identifier: <a>user-facing identifiers</a> and <a>application internal identifiers</a>.</p>
		  
		  <p><a>Application internal identifiers</a> are the part of a document format or protocol's <a>vocabulary</a> that are machine readable and not intended for display. These are often given meaningful names (generally in English) as an affordance for developers or content authors who have to work with or debug the contents of a document format or protocol.</p>
		  
		  <div class="req spec" id="charmod_content_internal_id">
		  <p class="advisement">Specifications that define <a>application internal identifiers</a> (which are never shown to users and are always used for matching or processing within an application or protocol) SHOULD limit the content to a printable subset of ASCII. <a>ASCII case-insensitive matching</a> is RECOMMENDED.</p>
          </div>
		  
		  <div class="req spec implementation" id="charmod_content_display">
		  <p class="advisement"><a>Application internal identifier</a> fields or values MUST be wrapped with a localizable display value when displayed to end-users.</p>
          </div>
		  
		  <p><a>User-facing identifiers</a> are the part of a document format or protocol's <a>vocabulary</a> that are assigned or edited by users or presented to the user for selection. Examples of user-facing identifiers include network names (such as SSIDs); device names; class, style, or attribute names; or user-defined settings or values. Identifiers of this sort are more complex to match due to the issues described in this document, but provide the best experience, particularly for users who do not speak English or who are less familiar with the Latin script.</p>
		  
		  <p>Many <a>user-facing identifiers</a> are also <a>user-supplied values</a> and can be assigned by users of the document format or protocol. The ability to use the natural language preferred by the user or the user's community or culture provides a superior user experience and makes features more accessible to audiences that may have limited language skills, particularly in English.</p>		  
		  
		  <div class="req spec" id="charmod_content_visible">
		  <p class="advisement">When identifiers are visible or potentially visible to users, specifications SHOULD allow the use of non-ASCII Unicode characters, in order to ensure that users in all languages can use the resulting document format or protocol with equal access. Case sensitivity (i.e. no case folding) is RECOMMENDED.</p>
          </div>
		  
		  <p>While a wide range of Unicode characters ought to be permitted, specifications can still impose certain practical limits on the content of <a>user-facing identifiers</a>. One example of a specification that defines content rules of this type can be found in <cite>Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax</cite> [[UAX31]].</p>

      <section id="choosingMatchingAlgorithm">
        <h2>Choosing a Matching Algorithm</h2>
        
        <p>The basic decision for choosing a matching algorithm to use for a given specification is the level of text normalization (which includes both case sensitivity and Unicode normalization) to apply to the strings being matched. Historically on the Web most specifications have opted for case-sensitive matching without Unicode normalization and this is the RECOMMENDED form of matching for all new specifications. However, there are cases where case-insensitivity and normalization are useful.</p>
        
        <p>A specification can choose to be case-insensitive if the benefit to users of the format or protocol in question outweighs the cost and complexity of the implementation. Because both case folding and normalization can affect the values being compared, including the presentation and, in some cases, the meaning of the text and because these operations are relatively expensive, choosing case-insensitivity is generally discouraged.</p>
        
        <p>A special case of case-insensitivity are vocabularies limited to the ASCII/Basic Latin range (that is, code points <span class=uname>U+0000</span> to <span class=uname>U+007F</span>). These specifications can choose to be case-insensitive only over that range of characters. This greatly simplifies the implementation of matching. However, this form of matching is not appropriate for specifications that allow a larger range of Unicode in identifiers or syntax, since it is difficult for users to understand the behavior of the matching and it is a disadvantage to users of non-ASCII scripts and languages. That is, users find it to be weird and unpredictable when <code class=kw>green</code> matches <code class=kw>GREEN</code> but <code class=kw>gr&#xfc;&#xdf;</code> doesn't match <code class=kw>GR&#xdc;&#x1e9e;</code> or possibly <code class=kw>GR&#xdc;SS</code> (but instead matches <code class=kw>GR&#xfc;&#xdf;</code>).</p>

        <h4>Converting to a Sequence of Unicode Code Points</h4>

	    <div class="req content" id="practice-useUTF-8">
        <p class="advisement">Content authors SHOULD enter and store resources in a Unicode character encoding (generally UTF-8 on the Web).</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The first step in comparing text is to ensure that both use the same digital representation. This means that implementations need to convert any text in a <a>legacy character encoding</a> to a sequence of Unicode code points. Normally this is done by applying a <a>transcoder</a> to convert the data to a consistent Unicode encoding form (such as UTF-8 or UTF-16). This allows bitwise comparison of the strings in order to determine string equality.</p> 
        
	    <div class="req content" id="practice-normalizingTranscoder">
        <p class="advisement">Content authors SHOULD choose a <a>normalizing transcoder</a> when converting legacy encoded text or resources to Unicode unless the mapping of specific characters interferes with the meaning.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>A <dfn>normalizing transcoder</dfn> is a <a>transcoder</a> that performs a conversion from a <a>legacy character encoding</a> to Unicode <em>and</em> ensures that the result is in Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC). For most legacy character encodings, it is possible to construct a normalizing transcoder (by using any transcoder followed by a normalizer); it is not possible to do so if the <a>legacy character encoding</a>'s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/REC-charmod-20050215/#def-repertoire">repertoire</a> contains characters not represented in Unicode. While normalizing transcoders only produce character sequences that are in NFC, the converted character sequence might not be <a>include normalized</a> (for example, if it begins with a combining mark).</p>
        
        <p>Because document formats on the Web often interact with or are processed using additional, external resources (for example, a CSS style sheet being applied to an HTML document), the consistent representation of text becomes important when matching values between documents that use different character encodings. Use of a normalizing transcoder helps ensure interoperability by making legacy encoded documents match the normally expected Unicode character sequence for most languages.</p>
        
        <p>Most transcoders used on the Web produce NFC as their output, but several do not. This is usually to allow the transcoder to be round-trip compatible with the source legacy character encoding, to preserve other character distinctions, or to be consistent with other transcoders in use in user-agents. This means that the Encoding specification [[!Encoding]] and various other important transcoding implementations include a number of non-normalizing transcoders. Indeed, most compatibility characters in Unicode exist solely for round-trip conversion from legacy encodings and a number of these have singleton canonical mappings in NFC. You saw an example of this <a href="#unicodeNormalization">earlier in the document</a> with <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x212B;</span> [<span class="uname">U+212B ANGSTROM SIGN</span>]</span>.</p> 
        
                
        <p>Bear in mind that most transcoders produce NFC output and that even those transcoders that do not produce NFC for all characters produce NFC for the preponderance of characters. In particular, there are no commonly-used transcoders that produce decomposed forms where precomposed forms exist or which produce a different combining character sequence from the normalized sequence (and this is true for <em>all</em> of the transcoders in [[!Encoding]]).</p>

        <p><a>Legacy character encodings</a> have generally outlived their usefulness on the Web.

        <section id="expandingCharacterEscapes">
        <h4>Expanding Character Escapes and Includes</h4>
        <p>Most document formats and protocols provide a means for encoding characters as an escape sequence or including external data, including text, into a  <a>resource</a>. This is discussed in detail in Section 4.6 of [[!CHARMOD]]  as well as <a href="#characterEscapes">above</a>.</p>
		
		<p>When performing matching, it is important to know when to interpret character escapes so that
		   a match succeeds (or fails) appropriately. Normally, escapes, references, and includes are processed
		   or expanded before performing matching (or match-sensitive processing), since these syntaxes exist to allow difficult-to-encode
		   sequences to be put into a document conveniently, yet allowing the characters to behave as-if they were
		   directly encoded as a codepoint sequence in the document in question.</p>
		 <p>One area where this can be complicated is deciding how <a>syntactic content</a> and <a>localizable content</a> interact.
		 For example, consider the following snippet of HTML:</p>
		 <aside class="example">
		 <pre>
&lt;p id="&amp;#x300;"&gt;Combining mark used as the value of 'id' attribute&lt;p&gt;
		 </pre>
		 </aside>
		 <p>Although technically the combining mark <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&nbsp;&#x0300;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0300 COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT​</span>]</span> combines with the preceding quote mark, HTML does not consider the character (whether or not it is encoded as an entity) to form part of the HTML syntax.</p>
		 
		  <p>When performing a matching operation on a resource, the general rule is to expand escapes on the same &quot;level&quot; as the user is  interacting with. For example, when considering the above example, a tool to view the source of the HTML would show the escape sequence <code>&amp;#x300;</code> as a string of characters starting with an ampersand. A JavaScript program, by contrast, operates on the browser's interpretation of the document and would match the character <code>U+0300</code> as the value of the attribute <code>id</code>.</p>
		  
		  <p>When processing the syntax of a document format, escapes are usually converted to the character sequence they represent before the processing of the syntax, except where explicitly forbidden by the format's processing rules. This allows resources to include characters of all types into the resource's syntactic structures.</p>
		  
		  <p>In some cases, pre-processing escapes creates problems. For example, expanding the sequence <code>&amp;lt;</code> before parsing an HTML document would produce document errors.</p>

          <h4>Additional Considerations for Normalization</h4>
          
          <p>A specific Unicode normalization form is not always appropriate or available to content authors and the text encoding choices of users might not be obvious to downstream consumers of the data. As shown in this document, there are many different ways that content authors or applications could choose to represent the same semantic values when inputting or exchanging text. Normalization can remove distinctions that the users applied intentionally. Therefore, the <a href="#matchingAlgorithm">matching algorithm</a> specifies the use of Unicode normalization when performing case-fold matching of strings&mdash;and then only internally to the algorithm. Imposing normalization on content can represent a barrier to users and implementers. Thus:</p>
      
	      <div class="req spec" id="charmod_n11n_should_not">
          <p class="advisement">Specifications SHOULD NOT specify a Unicode normalization form for encoding, storage, or interchange of a given vocabulary.</p>
          </div>
          
	      <div class="req implementation" id="charmod_n11n_must_not">
          <p class="advisement">Implementations MUST NOT alter the normalization form of syntactic content (including user-supplied values) or localizable content being exchanged, read, parsed, or processed except when required to do so as a side-effect of text transformation such as transcoding the content to a Unicode character encoding, case folding, or other user-initiated change, as consumers or the content itself might depend on the de-normalized representation.</p>
          </div>
          
	      <div class="req implementation" id="charmod_n11n_authoring">
          <p class="advisement">Authoring tools SHOULD provide a means of normalizing resources and warn the user when a given resource is not in Unicode Normalization Form C.</p>
          </div>
          
          <p class=note>A specification that requires storage and interchange of text in a specific normalization form needs to address the requirements in <a href="#normalizing-spec"></a>.</p>
       
          <p>Specifications are generally discouraged from requiring formats or protocols to store or exchange data in a normalized form unless there are specific, clear reasons why the additional requirement is necessary. As many document formats on the Web do not require normalization, content authors might occasionally rely on denormalized character sequences. A normalization step could negatively affect such content.</p>
          
          <p>The canonical normalization forms (form NFC or form NFD) are intended to preserve the meaning and presentation of the text to which they are applied. This is not always the case, which is one reason why normalization is not recommended. NFC has the advantage that almost all legacy data (if transcoded trivially, one-to-one, to a Unicode encoding), as well as data created by current software or entered by users on most (but not all) keyboards, is already in this form. NFC also has a slight compactness advantage and is a better match to user expectations in most languages with respect to the relationship between characters and graphemes.</p>
          
	      <div class="req spec" id="charmod_n11n_compat">
          <p class="advisement">Specifications SHOULD NOT specify compatibility normalization forms (NFKC, NFKD).</p>
          </div>
          
	      <div class="req implementation" id="charmod_n11n_compat_impl">
          <p class="advisement">Implementations MUST NOT apply compatibility normalization forms (NFKC, NFKD) unless specifically requested by the end user.</p>
          </div>
          
          <p>The compatibility normalization forms (form NFKC and form NFKD) change the structure and lose the meaning of the text in important ways. Users sometimes use characters with a compatibility mapping in Unicode on purpose or they use characters in a legacy character encoding that have a compatibility mapping when converted to Unicode. This has to be considered intentional on the part of the content author. Although NFKC/NFKD can sometimes be useful in "find" operations or string searching localizable content, erasing compatibility differences is harmful.</p>

          <p class=note>Requiring NFC requires additional care on the part of the specification developer, as content on the Web generally is not in a known normalization state. Boundary and error conditions for denormalized content need to be carefully considered and well-specified in these cases. </p>

          <p class="advisement">Content authors SHOULD always encode text using consistent Unicode character sequences to facilitate matching, even if a Unicode normalization form is included in the matching performed by the format or implementation.</p>
          </div>
          
          <p>In order for their content to be processed consistently, content authors should try to use a consistent sequence of code points to represent the same text. While content can be in any normalization form or might use a de-normalized (but valid) Unicode character sequence, inconsistency of representation will cause implementations to treat the different sequences as different. The best way to ensure consistent selection, access, extraction, processing, or display is to always use NFC. </p>
          
          <div class="req content" id="charmod_n11n_combining_marks">
          <p class="advisement">Content authors SHOULD NOT include combining marks without a preceding base character in a resource.</p>
          </div>

          <p>There can be exceptions to this. For example, when making a list of characters (such as a list of [[!Unicode]] characters), an author might want to use combining marks without a corresponding base character. However, use of a combining mark without a base character can cause unintentional display or processing problems, such as when a na&#xef;ve implementation combines the combining mark with adjacent syntactic, user-supplied, or localizable content. For example, if you were to use  a combining mark, such as the character <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&nbsp;&#x0301;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0301 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT​</span>]</span>, as the start of a <code>class</code> attribute value in HTML, the class name might not display properly in your editor and be difficult to edit.</p>
          
          <p>Some recommended base characters include <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x25CC;</span> [<span class="uname">U+25CC DOTTED CIRCLE</span>]</span> (when the base character needs to be visible) or <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">&#x00A0;</span> [<span class="uname">U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE</span>]</span> (when the base character should be invisible).</p>
          
          <p>Since content authors do not always follow these guidelines:</p>
          
          <div class="req spec" id="charmod_n11n_boundaries">
          <p class="advisement">Specifications of vocabularies MUST define the boundaries between syntactic content and character data as well as entity boundaries (if the language has any include mechanism).</span> These need to include any boundary that may create conflicts when processing or matching content when instances of the language are processed, while allowing for character escapes designed to express arbitrary characters.</p>

          <p>Vocabularies usually put a premium on predictability for content authors and users. Case-sensitive matching is the easiest to implement and introduces the least potential for confusion, since it generally consists of a comparison of the underlying Unicode code point sequence. Because it is not affected by considerations such as language-specific case mappings, it produces the least surprise for document authors that have included words, such as the <a href="#caseMappingLanguageSensitivity">Turkish examples</a> above, in their syntactic content.</p>

         <p class=note>An ASCII-only vocabulary can exist inside a document format or protocol that allows a larger range of Unicode in identifiers or values. For example [[CSS-SYNTAX-3]] defines the format of CSS style sheets in a way that allows the full range of Unicode to be used for identifiers and values. However, CSS specifications always define CSS keywords using a subset of the ASCII range.

          <p>Language specific tailoring is not recommended for formal languages because the language information can be hard to obtain, verify, or manage and because the resulting operations can produce results that frustrate users or which fail for some users and succeed for others depending on the language configuration that they are using or the configuration of the system where the match is performed.</p>

            <p class="advisement">Specifications that define a regular expression syntax MUST provide at least Basic Unicode Level 1 support per [[!UTS18]] and SHOULD provide Extended or Tailored (Levels 2 and 3) support.</p>
            </div>


		<p>Regular expression syntaxes are sometimes useful in defining a format or protocol, since they allow users to specify values that are only partially known or which can vary in predictable ways. As seen in the various sections of this document, there is variation in the different ways that characters can be encoded in Unicode and this potentially interferes with how strings are specified or matched in expressions. For example, counting characters might need to depend on grapheme boundaries rather than the number of Unicode code points used; caseless matching might need to consider variations in case folding; or the Unicode normalization of the expression or text being processed might need to be considered.</p>
			
			<p>Unicode Regular Expressions Level 1 support includes the ability to specify Unicode code points in regular expressions, including via the use of escapes, and to access Unicode character properties as well as certain kinds of boundaries common to most regular expression syntaxes.</p>
			
			<p>Level 2 extends this with a number of important capabilities, notably the ability to select text on certain kinds of <a>grapheme cluster</a> boundary and support for case conversion (two topics mentioned extensively above). Level 3 provides for locale [[LTLI]] based tailoring of regular expressions, which are less useful in formal languages but can be useful in processing <a>localizable content</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="changeLog" class="informative">Changes Since the Last Published Version</h2>
      <p>Changes to this document (beginning with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-charmod-norm-20180420/Overview.html">Working Draft</a> of 2018-04-20) are available via the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/charmod-norm/commits/gh-pages">github commit log</a>.</p>
      
      <p>This version changes the which normalization step is optional in the <a href="#CanonicalFoldNormalizationStep">Unicode Canonical Case Fold Normalization Step</a> and the <a href="#CompatibilityFoldNormalizationStep">Unicode Compatibility Case Fold Normalization Step</a>. This version requires normalization as the first step and makes normalization of the output optional. This change is based on testing and conversation with Unicode.</p>
